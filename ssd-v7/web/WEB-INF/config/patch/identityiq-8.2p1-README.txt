README for 8.2p1
Release Notes

Release: 8.2
Patch: 1

Patch Deliverable:

  identityiq-8.2p1.jar

General Information:

  IdentityIQ 8.2p1 is a patch for IdentityIQ 8.2.  All patches are cumulative,
  so this patch includes all changes from previously released patches for
  IdentityIQ 8.2.

  If you are deploying IdentityIQ using a war file, you will need to
  update the war file contents with those from this patch using the
  following sample commands as a guide.  Place identityiq.war and
  identityiq-8.2p1.jar in the current working directory and use the
  following commands to update the war file:

    mkdir iiq-8.2p1
    cd iiq-8.2p1
    jar xf ../identityiq-8.2p1.jar
    jar uf ../identityiq.war *

Installation Instructions:

  1. Stop the application server (or the IdentityIQ application
     if supported by the application server).

  2. Un-jar the IdentityIQ patch in the IdentityIQ installation
     directory.

  3. Using a database client, execute the
     upgrade_identityiq_tables-8.2p1 DDL script in WEB-INF/database
     that is appropriate for your database type.   The database scripts are
     cumulative, so you will receive errors for the schema changes that have
     already been applied in previous patches.

  4. Apply the patch by using a command line interface to execute the command
     "iiq patch 8.2p1" (without the quotes) from the WEB-INF/bin directory.

  5. Start the application server (or the IdentityIQ application if
     supported by the application server).

Upgrade Considerations:

  - This patch contains a fix for the configuration of the Hibernate L2 cache. 
    In the 8.2 GA release, the ehcache jar files were updated to the 3.8.1 version. 
    These updated jar files now use the jcache (JSR-107) specification to 
    interface with Hibernate. This change in the interface with Hibernate and 
    the L2 cache caused the ehcache configuration using the ehcache.xml file to no 
    longer work. This caused the objects being stored in the L2 cache to have an 
    unlimited TTL and objects changed on one server would not always be reflected 
    on other IIQ UI and Task servers. This fix includes an update to 
    hibernate.cfg.xml file to specify the ehcache.xml file to use for the ehcache 
    configuration. Also, the ehcache.xml file was updated to use the JSR-107 
    specification format. All default values that were in the file before still 
    remain the same, but the format of the file has changed. If any customizations 
    have been made to either of these files, then care needs to be taken when 
    upgrading.

  - The escapeHTML utility method is now restored to the Velocity spTools.

  - The IQService version must match the IdentityIQ server version including
    the major release and patch versions. When one is upgraded, the other must
    be upgraded as well so that the version and patch levels match. For more
    information on upgrading the IQService, see the IdentityIQ Installation
    Guide's chapter on upgrading.
